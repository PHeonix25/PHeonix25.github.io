I'm Pat Hermens, an Australian that's been based in the Netherlands for the last 5 years, but has moved back to my home-town of Sydney in late 2019.
I've been a .NET developer for 15+ years (and a technical manager for the past few), an international public speaker, a happy husband and father, but most of all, I'm just a big nerd.
Over the course of my career, I've found that mentoring and coaching, sharing fun stories, and working on interesting challenges & creative solutions really motivate me, and look forward to doing these things together with you.

If you're interested in my previous roles or experience you can check out my [Developer Story](http://stackoverflow.com/story/phermens) or my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/phermens),
or if looking to get in touch for any other reason, just check out the links to my other stuff online, listed below.

Cheers!  
-**Pat**
