title: Hi!
permalink: /about/
---

I'm a loud Australian that's been living in the Netherlands for a few years -- and still trying to learn Dutch.
At risk of sounding cliché; I'm an skilled .Net developer, experienced public speaker, husband and father, but most of all, a geek. 
Over the course of my career, I've found that interesting problems & inspiring solutions are what gets me out of bed in the morning.

If you're interested in my previous roles or experience you can look at my [Developer Story](http://stackoverflow.com/story/phermens), 
or if looking to get in touch for any other reason, just check out the links to my other stuff online, listed below.

Cheers!
