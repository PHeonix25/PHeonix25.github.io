This is a site that I've set up for my personal blogging - all nice and clean, and simple - using Jekyll and GitHub Pages for deployment.

Feel free to copy parts of the code or theme/layout/style, but please remember that **the content is all mine**, please don't steal that!

Alternatively, if you're looking to set up a Jekyll site (*maybe one that looks like mine?*), you could start at the beginning of [my series on the topic](https://hermens.com.au/2016/10/01/Getting-started-with-Jekyll-Part-1/), or check out the [`jekyll` category](https://hermens.com.au/archive/#jekyll) on my blog?

## author
I'm Pat, this is my blog. 

If you want to know more about me, just check out my [about page](https://hermens.com.au/about/).

## theme
I based my theme off [`simple`](https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple) and have continued to modify it to suit my needs.

From the `simple` README, it is described in the following manner:
> `simple` is a theme designed for blogger using static site generator like jekyll, Hexo etc.
> Especially for those who writes in both Chinese and English. The font-type setting looks really good when writers use Chinese mixed with English.
> Supposedly, this could work with Japanese as well but never had a chance to try.
