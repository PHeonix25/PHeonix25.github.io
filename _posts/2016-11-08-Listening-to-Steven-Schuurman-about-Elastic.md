Tonight I got the opportunity to meet with [Steven Schuurman](https://twitter.com/stevenschuurman) from [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) - aka. the guys that created ELK/Elastic Stack
<!--description-->

## *Super tof!*
Jazeker! Not only did he give us some great stories about the successes of Elastic Stack (all the way up to the reversioning of `v2`+`v3`+`v4` into `v5`) but I also took the opportunity to share a beer with him after the talk and learn about how Elastic works as a development-oriented company.

## Some background on my expectations
Firstly, I didn't expect the talk to be very technical, because although Steven is listed as a [Founder of Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/about/leadership) he is no [Shay Bannon](http://thedudeabides.com/). **That being said**, the way that Steven was able to deliver the story of Elastic - and growing a company from a team of 4 to a team of 400 - shows that he has had his finger on the (technical) pulse for the whole trip, and what a trip it must have been.

## Growing to 400...
Steven explained to us that growing (aggressively) to 400 people is no mean feat, but one of the things that surprised me the most was that he described how he (or Shay) will interview **EVERY. SINGLE. INTERVIEWEE**. This blew my mind for a few reasons, the first of which is that there are only so many hours in the week! Secondly, I've been involved in hiring a lot of people [here at Coolblue](http://www.careersatcoolblue.com/) (and my face is still the placeholder image for some of the roles) and I don't even think I would have the patience and strength to interview thousands of people over 4 years to find 400 good "culture-fit"'s.

However, thankfully, he made it clear that Elastic is a company that has employees in over 27 countries (*I hope I heard that right*), and that they have developers in every country they have employees, which brings it almost to the same level of international representation here at Coolblue in IT. I can only hope that some of those interviews were "on-site" and he could take a nice break at the time.

## Releasing software at Elastic
Steven took the time to explain that the way that Elastic delivers software in a very "agile fashion", and that they have teams that vary in size from 3 to 10. Each is spear-headed by a Team Lead (i.e.: HR) **and** a Tech Lead (i.e.: Vision), and those responsibilities don't (or rarely) overlap, but they have no title except "Software Engineer" and "VP of Engineering" - even though some people have additional responsibilties, they are all working at the same level and that the teams would prefer to fall back on "time spent with Elastic" rather than development expertise when tough decisions have to be made. Personally, I wonder how that will pan out over time, but with them the best of luck. In some ways it reminded me of the GitHub "No Managers, except Developers that are Managers" policies of years-past.  

## Delivering value? 
Previously, Steven explained, there were a lot of teams working to their own cadence. In recent times though, they have sought to align the development teams with quarterly sessions to define a release and work towards it. For me, this is most visible in the restructuring of the versioning - whatever is ready will make it to `v6` (or `v5.1`?) and whatever is not, won't. Simple, easy and clear. As such, it seems that work at Elastic is spent less on "sprints" and other ceremony, and more on "working towards a common goal", but Steven didn't get the chance to elaborate on this (or maybe each team does it differently)

## Team Independence?

## Working Remotely?

## Next steps.
