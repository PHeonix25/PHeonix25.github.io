I started my [2018 retrospective](/2018/12/31/Wow-what-a-year/) by questioning what motivates me, which has been a big part of my bio for a long time. Do _"interesting problems & inspiring solutions"_ still _"get me out of bed in the morning"_? In this post I'll talk about why that's not necessarily the case, and what's going to replace it.

A few keen observers that read my last post asked me why I didn't close out the introduction with a matching conclusion.
The truth is, because I wasn't ready to talk about it.
This is the follow-up post that hopes to address it directly -- and then I can get back to technical + managerial posts, I promise!

Like I mentioned in the previous post; toward the end of 2018, from about November on, I started noticing that _"interesting problems & inspiring solutions"_ weren't helping me get out of bed any more.

Don't get me wrong!
A lot of the challenges I had in my day-job were certainly challenging, and required "inspiring" solutions, but they weren't interesting; I couldn't easily solve them, and when I finally did (_occasionally with the help of my peers_), it took far too much time/energy and I myself wasn't even convinced of the outcome, let alone "inspired".

It felt -- and to a degree, still feels -- like I'm just punching the clock, doing the same hours, but with less results, and a lot more disappointment, but of course, I covered _some of_ that in the retrospective.

So I started using [the results of the retro](/2018/12/31/Wow-what-a-year/#adapt) to figure out what gave me energy, and what I wanted to focus on: what did I do that could continue to give me concrete, repeatable, identifiable results, directly correlated with my inputs, much like coding did (and continues to).

Now, I love my job.
I love that I can enable and empower so many people in the position that have.
I love that I have the responsibility and accountability for the amazing work that we're continuing to produce at an amazing rate.
I honestly love my colleagues and the company I work for!
I'm continually amazed by the people I've hired and the great jobs they are doing.
I'm just trying to make clear, to myself, what areas it is that I **want** to improve, and then I can check if that's something I **could**, or _should_, do in my current role.
This post is ultimately just a means of catharsis for me.

Then I read [this post](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/) from [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) which was a follow-up to [another awesome post](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) she made a few years ago.
I found myself nodding along to both; the idea that highly skilled engineers should try being managers, and highly skilled technical managers have been developers/engineers at some point in time.
If it's not a "promotion" into technical management, then it's not a _demotion_ to try something else either, right?

## Cool, so that means...?

I found that a lot of the events that I enjoyed the most this year, were when I had the ability to tell stories from my heart.
Addressing an engaged crowd with something as simple as an introduction to a department meeting, or as storied as sharing the history of my company with new-joiners, or as entertaining as being an MC at an amazing work function, or sharing my failures with new developers from a completely different background ...and even that one time I used 300+ slides in a guest lecture on "decision making and continuous delivery from the perspective of a fast-moving company". These were all awesome.

The key to most of my highlights in 2018?

The moments that gave me the most motivation?

**It was when I had a story to tell, and managed to tell it well.**

Thankfully, making new friends, learning new presentation skills, and pushing myself to improve -- _including giving my first presentation EVER just working from memory & background without pre-prepared slides_ -- were all nice side-effects of just doing something that I find really fun!

So I've decided to spend a fair bit of my time this year further improving these skills; delivering a well-prepared story, well!

## That's quite a change

Yeah, this could be just another [left turn at Albuquerque](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongTurnAtAlbuquerque) that ends with hilarious comedic value for you, the viewer, but how will we know if I don't try?

Thankfully, I feel that there might be an opportunity to pursue this within my current organisation, especially considering how supportive they've been of me and my "speaking habit" in the past.

I would love that: sticking it out with friends, sharing our amazing successes (and failures!), helping teams to learn from others, and especially finding the right way to bring "bad news" to a group, while leaving them feeling energised and motivated. These are the key skills I feel I still need to improve, and intend to work on over the next year.

I'll also reach back to that previous post and some of the "one-liners" in the summary that helped me to understand why I should work toward this... Remember these?

- Build adventure into every day, whatever that means to you
- Consciously choose everything you do
- What is most interesting to you? Do that!
- What does the world need now, that you are uniquely able to deliver?
- Find and celebrate the soul or essence of every organisation
- Follow your curiosity, talk to more people, try things, tell your story
- Look for where your personal voice and commercial opportunity meet
- What is the "from... to..." you want to create?

Looking through that list, which I really developed an affinity for, I think this is a good(_-enough_) goal for now.
Keeping in mind that it's quite possible, maybe even probable that I have read the list wrong, and you're like the viewer watching Bugs Bunny reading the map upside down and screaming at the screen...
If so, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/phermens), but otherwise, I'm going to leave it at that for now.

## So, ...the bio?

Yeah, I'll also update my introduction and bio soon.
"Interesting challenges" has become quite clichÃ©, and if I want to spend more time focussing on telling stories well, I might as well add it in there.
I'm still trying to figure out the right wording, but how's something like this sound?

> I'm Pat Hermens, an Aussie that's been based in the Netherlands for the last 5 years.
> I've been a .NET developer for 15+ years (and a technical manager for the past few), an international public speaker, a happy husband and father, but most of all, I'm just a geek.
> Over the course of my career, I've found that sharing fun stories about interesting challenges & creative solutions motivates me.

It's a bit bland, right? Wish me luck :)
