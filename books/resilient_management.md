## General

A lot of the structure of the book is based off Tuckmans' [Stages of Group Development][00-01].

* Chapter 1 = Forming
* Chapter 2 = Storming, Norming
* Chapter 3 = Performing

The book then moves into more "the general skills you will need" in Chapters 4 & 5.

* Chapter 4 = Communication skill
* Chapter 5 = Creating resiliency (from where the book gets it's name)

## Chapter 1 - Meet your team (Forming)

> _"You're optimising (your team) for balance, not perfection."_

[BICEPS][01-01] (Belonging, Improvement, Choice, Equality, Predictability, Significance) are categories of the core needs that everyone has.

* Belonging: _"not missing out"_
* Improvement (aka. Progress): _"what it takes to feel productive"_
* Choice (aka. Autonomy): _"it's all about balance"_
* Equality (aka. Fairness): _"real or perceived, it needs to be fair"_
* Predictability: _"we need a balance of consistency and unpredictability"_
* Significance (aka. Status): _"hierarchy, title, responsibilities, but also recognition"_

There's a good example given about "desk moves" challenging all of the above!

* **B**: Same group? Different floor?
* **I**: Announcement might be surprise/interruption
* **C**: Can I choose? Has someone chosen for me?
* **E**: Closer to the food! Better views?
* **P**: No longer the same spot every day
* **S**: Corner office? Sitting with peers? Locality?

### Work style and preferences

Her "First 1:1 Questions" (_that I adapted/copied into my "[First sync questions][syncq]"_) are explained in depth here!

### Help the team to know you

* Actions will be discussed in Chapter 4.
* Ask yourself _"what are you optimising for"_?
* Use the Mad Lib exercise (included below)

#### "Mad Lib" exercise

> I'm a ____________ leader, who values ____________ and ____________. \
> You'll see this when I ____________________________________________. \
> I support my team by ____________________________ and I stay aligned \
> with company values by ____________________________________________. \
> I thrive in a _________________________________________ environment. \
> I commit to being _________________________________________________.

In short:

* What do you optimise for in your current role?
* What do you hope your team mates will lean on you for?
* What management skills are you currently working on learning or improving?

## Chapter 2 - Grow your teammates (Storming, Norming)

> To grow in this role, you'll wear four hats: Mentoring, Coaching, Sponsoring, and Delivering feedback.

### Mentoring

Mentoring is defined as doling out advice, sharing our perspective and helping some else problem solve based on that information.

> Managers often default to mentoring mode because it feels like the fastest way to solve a problem, but it falls short in helping your teammate to connect their _own_ dots.

### Coaching

Coaching is doing two primary things: Asking open questions, and Reflecting.

When someone comes to you with a challenge/problem, try asking questions like:

* What's most important to you about it?
* What's holding you back?
* What does success look like?

A great example is given about a team member asking about a promotion. You can handle this conversation really well by using open questions:

* What would you be able to do in the new level that you can't do in your current one?
* What skills are required in the new level? What are some of the ways that you've honed those skills?
* Who are the people already at that level that you want to emulate? What about them do you want to emulate?

"Reflecting", as described in this chapter, is the art of inverting and mirroring their statements, turning them into questions:

* What I'm hearing is... Is that correct?

This also forces the other person to do a bit more introspection and help them to see other angles on the same problem, and for the both of you to find the right problem statement (FYI: very helpful in a larger organisation)

> It takes a lot of time/effort/practice to default to Coaching, rather than Mentoring, but it's worth it because the introspection and creativity it inspires created deeper and longer-lasting growth for your teammate.

### Sponsoring

Sponsorship is all about feeling "on the hook" for getting someone to the next level.

The [Center for Talent Innovation][cftin] routinely measures the [career benefits of sponsorship][02-02], and they have found that when someone has a sponsor they are way more likely to have access to career-lauching work.

Members of under-represented groups are typically [over-mentored and under-sponsored][02-03] due to [_in-group bias_][ingrp].

### Constructing and Delivering Feedback

> The best feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered in a way that ensures the receiver can actually absorb it.

There's a great breakdown about the "feedback equation" here which looks like this:

**Observation** of behaviour + **Impact** of behaviour + **Request** or **Question** = **Specific, Actionable Feedback**

* **Observation** is the who/what/when/where part of the situation that YOU have witnessed
* **Impact** is great if it's measurable, but it's often personal. Asking yourself "_but what is the impact of **that**?_" can help here.
* **Request** or **Question** can often fall into the trap of Mentoring-mode (see above). Switch to Coaching-mode whenever possible!

As an example (directly from the book):

* **Problem Statement**: Someone on your team is writing super-terse emails.
* **Observation**: _Over the last few weeks, I've noticed that your emails to me contain fewer than five words on average._
* **Impact**:
  * _As a result, I have a hard time understanding what you mean._ - good, but we can do better.
  * _I often need to reply to your email with more questions to get clarification or add context._ - getting there...
  * _This adds much more time to the overall process of us communicating._ - BINGO, found the impact.
* **Question**: _Can you help me understand what you're optimising for?_, and then: _How can we come to a compromise going forward?_

Sharing this formula & encouraging others to use it will hopefully contribute to an open & honest culture. Personally, I feel that making the impact visible is the biggest part that is often overlooked here. "You want me to write longer emails to make you feel good?" vs "You want me to write more detailed emails that provides adequate context for my decisions".

### Striking a balance

You can try and balance all of the above in your syncs (aka. 1:1's). These sessions are normally covering four types of scenarios:

* Build trust,
* Gain shared context,
* Plan out and support career growth, and
* Solve problems

No matter what sort of items you're discussing, you could work to identify what skill(s) from the above section you're using, and help the teammate to understand why you chose to focus on applying that skill.

## Chapter 3 - Set clear expectations (Performing)

Make sure the team's collective expectations are well documented (aka. "Values exercise"?). These normally are broken down into the following sections:

* Roles and responsibilities (inc. the manager)
* Vision and priorities
* Collaborating, communicating, and shipping work

... these areas reach back to the **B**, **E**, and **P** core needs.

### Roles and responsibilities

[RACI-matrices][racim] are good tools in this regard! Really helps to clarify who is responsible/accountable and who just needs to be consulted or informed. Venn diagrams are also helpful in getting more fine-grained organisational insight, and clarifying the Responsibility cell from the matrix.

Building a RACI matrix and the corresponding Venn diagram can be done with any overlapping roles (think Hiring Manager, Recruiter, and Sourcer, or Heads of Design, Branding, and Tech), not to push responsibility DOWN, but instead to highlight where responsibilities are SHARED and where they overlap - all in order to prevent miscommunication/maligned expectations.

### Vision and Priorities

This is the first time I've heard of a [VMSO statement][03-01] (Vision, Mission, Strategy, and Objectives), but it makes sense in a world full of OKRs and KPIs...

* **Vision**: the "north-star" of the organisation/group, a pipe dream
* **Mission**: a more grounded version of the vision, that's still motivating, but more about the team
* **Strategy**: what is the team uniquely set up to do in order to achieve the Mission?
* **Objectives**: Measurable goals that reflect the mission and strategy; used to benchmark progress.

### Team Practices

1. Identify meetings that the team has together; their purpose, frequency, and participants - reassess this every few months:
    1. Are the descriptions still accurate?
    1. Have some of these blended together, or has the purpose evolved?
    1. Can we improve their frequency, goals, ground-rules, attendees?
1. Identify email & chat channels; their expectations around response-times and usage.
    1. Which channel will get a message to all members of your team?
    1. Which channel should be used for asking questions about project status?
    1. Is there a URL to find OKRs and their status?
    1. Is there a specific channel for questions people have of you/your team?
1. Identify how your team works together, evaluate their expectations:
    1. Do they approach problems together? Pairing on code, or splitting up work?
    1. How do they communicate progress? Notify/update people on updates/outages?
    1. How do they hold each other accountable? Is there a feedback culture?

You can do this last point by keeping it **REAL**:

* **R**eflect on the dynamics in the room
* **E**levate the conversations
* **A**ssume best intentions
* **L**isten to learn
