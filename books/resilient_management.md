## General

A lot of the structure of the book is based off Tuckmans' [Stages of Group Development][00-01].

* Chapter 1 = Forming
* Chapter 2 = Storming, Norming
* Chapter 3 = Performing

The book then moves into more "the general skills you will need" in Chapters 4 & 5.

* Chapter 4 = Communication skill
* Chapter 5 = Creating resiliency (from where the book gets it's name)

## Chapter 1 - Forming

> _"You're optimising (your team) for balance, not perfection."_

[BICEPS][01-01] (Belonging, Improvement, Choice, Equality, Predictability, Significance) are categories of the core needs that everyone has.

* Belonging: _"not missing out"_
* Improvement (aka. Progress): _"what it takes to feel productive"_
* Choice (aka. Autonomy): _"it's all about balance"_
* Equality (aka. Fairness): _"real or perceived, it needs to be fair"_
* Predictability: _"we need a balance of consistency and unpredictability"_
* Significance (aka. Status): _"hierarchy, title, responsibilities, but also recognition"_

There's a good example given about "desk moves" challenging all of the above!

* B: Same group? Different floor?
* I: Announcement might be surprise/interruption
* C: Can I choose? Has someone chosen for me?
* E: Closer to the food! Better views?
* P: No longer the same spot every day
* S: Corner office? Sitting with peers? Locality?

### Work style and preferences

Her "First 1:1 Questions" (that I adapted/copied into my "[First sync questions][syncq]") are explained in depth here!

### Help the team to know you

* Actions will be discussed in Chapter 4.
* Ask yourself _"what are you optimising for"_?
* Use the Mad Lib exercise (included below)

#### "Mad Lib" exercise

> I'm a ____________ leader, who values ____________ and ____________. \
> You'll see this when I ____________________________________________. \
> I support my team by ____________________________ and I stay aligned \
> with company values by ____________________________________________. \
> I thrive in a _________________________________________ environment. \
> I commit to being _________________________________________________.
